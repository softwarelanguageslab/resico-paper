### Description

This repository contains the scripts and datasets of the paper "A Text Classification Approach to API Type Resolution from incomplete Code Snippets".

### Details

- The folder `datasets` contains the datasets used for the external evaluation of the trained models.

- The folder `discussion` contains the script and data used in the figure which is part of the Discussion section.

- The folder `rqs` groups the scripts, tools and results for each of the four research questions answered in the paper. The folders `rq1`, `rq2` and `rq4` are included here. The folder `rq3` is not included since this research question is related to the benchmarking of previous research questions, and we measured the times while computing RQ1 and RQ2. In the specific case of the folder `rq1` its results are not included in this GitHub repository due to size limitations. In other words, the trained models and the evaluation results are considerable large to include them here. You can access those results and models via this permanent link: [https://zenodo.org/record/6467613#.Yl17kidBz0p](https://zenodo.org/record/6467613#.Yl17kidBz0p)
